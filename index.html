<h1>The Baby Braves</h1>
<p> How the Braves went from worst to first. The Atlanta Braves experienced a sensational season this past year. The Braves achieved 90 wins this season compared to 72 wins two years ago. Every analyst projected them to finish last in the N.L. East and wrote them off because the roster was the youngest in the Major Leagues. By May and still leading the N.L. East people began to notice.</p>
<p> With a payroll just north of 80 million dollars, it was one of the lowest in baseball. Most teams with young, inexperienced players combined with a low budget experience sub .500 seasons. This was not the case for the Braves. With the best farm system in baseball the Braves in spring training let the minor league players with high potentials try out to see if they could make the opening day roster. While most were sent back to the minors, some proved themselves worthy of a call up to the show.</p>
<p> Lets take a look back at the season, and past seasons of Atlanta Braves Baseball. You'll find that the past few years have had a lot of up and downs.</p>
